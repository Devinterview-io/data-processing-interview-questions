## 1. What is _data preprocessing_ in the context of _machine learning_?

**Data preprocessing**, often known as **data cleaning**, is a foundational step in the machine learning pipeline. It focuses on transforming and organizing raw data to make it suitable for model training and to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.

Data preprocessing typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtaining data from various sources such as databases, files, or external APIs.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data, outliers, and noise.

3. **Data Transformation**: Converting raw data into a form more amenable to ML algorithms. This can include standardization, normalization, encoding, and feature scaling.

4. **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most relevant attributes (or features) to be used as input for the ML model.

5. **Dataset Splitting**: Separating the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

6. **Data Augmentation**: Generating additional training examples through techniques such as image or text manipulation.

7. **Text Preprocessing**: Specialized tasks for handling unstructured textual data, including tokenization, stemming, and handling stopwords.

8. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

### Code Example: Data Preprocessing

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

# Load the data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Perform label encoding
encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['category'] = encoder.fit_transform(data['category'])

# Split the data into features and labels
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
<br>

## 2. Why is _data cleaning_ essential before _model training_?

**Data cleaning** is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline, helping to prevent issues that arise from inconsistent or noisy data.

### Consequences of Skipping Data Cleaning

- **Model Biases**: Failing to clean data can introduce biases, leading the model to make skewed predictions.
- **Erroneous Correlations**: Unfiltered data can suggest incorrect or spurious relationships.
- **Inaccurate Metrics**: The performance of a model trained on dirty data may be misleadingly positive, masking its real-world flaws.
- **Inferior Feature Selection**: Dirty data can hamper the model's ability to identify the most impactful features.

### Key Aspects of Data Cleaning for Model Training

1. **Handling Missing Data**: Select the most suitable method, such as imputation, for missing values.
  
2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identify and address outliers, ensuring they don't unduly influence the model's behavior.

3. **Noise Reduction**: Using techniques such as binning or smoothing to reduce the impact of noisy data points.

4. **Addressing Data Skewness**: For imbalanced datasets, techniques like oversampling or undersampling can help.

5. **Normalization and Scaling**: Ensure data is on a consistent scale to enable accurate model training.

6. **Ensuring Data Consistency**: Methods such as data type casting can bring uniformity to data representations.

7. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Constructing or isolating meaningful features can enhance model performance.

8. **Text and Categorical Data Handling**: Encoding, vectorizing, and other methods convert non-numeric data to a usable format.

9. **Data Integrity**: Data cleaning aids in data validation, ensuring records adhere to predefined standards, such as data ranges or formats.

### Code Example: Data Cleaning with Python's pandas Library

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Handling missing values
median_age = df['age'].median()
df['age'].fillna(median_age, inplace=True)

# Outlier treatment using Z-Score (replacing outliers with median)
from scipy import stats
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df['income']))
df['income'] = np.where(z_scores > 3, median_income, df['income'])

# Normalization and scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['feature1', 'feature2']])

# Data type consistency
df['gender'] = df['gender'].astype('category')

# Text and categorical data handling (One-Hot-Encoding)
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['location'])

# Data integrity (example: age cannot be negative)
df = df[df['age'] >= 0]
```
<br>

## 3. What are common _data quality issues_ you might encounter?

**Data quality issues** can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models, leading to suboptimal performance.

### Common Data Quality Issues

#### 1. Missing Data

Attributes lacking data can impede the learning process. Common strategies include data imputation, decrease in model sensitivity to missing data, or special treatment of missing values as a distinct category.

#### 2. Outliers

Outliers, though not necessarily incorrect, can unduly skew statistical measures and models. You can choose to remove such anomalous points or transform them to reduce their influence.

#### 3. Inconsistent Data

Inconsistencies can arise from manual entry or parameter disparities. Aggressive data cleaning and standardization are effective steps in countering this issue.

#### 4. Duplicate Data

Redundant information offers no additional value and can lead to overfitting in models. It's wise to detect and eliminate replicas.

#### 5. Data Corrupt or Incorrect

Data can be incomplete or outright incorrect due to various reasons including measurement errors, data transmission errors, or bugs in data extraction pipelines. Quality assurance protocols should be implemented throughout the data pipeline.

#### 6. Data Skewness

Skewed distributions, which are either highly asymmetric or include a significant bias, can misrepresent the true data characteristics. Techniques such as log-transformations or bootstrapping can address this.

### Visual Data Analysis for Quality Assessment

Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are invaluable in deducing characteristics about the quality of the dataset, like the presence of outliers.
<br>

## 4. Explain the difference between _structured_ and _unstructured data_.

Machine learning applications rely on two primary forms of data: **structured** and **unstructured** data.

### Structured Data

- **Definition**: Structured data follows a strict, defined format. It is typically organized into rows and columns and is found in databases and spreadsheets. It also powers the backbone of most business operations and many analytical tools.
  
- **Example**: A company's sales report containing columns for date, product, salesperson, and revenue.

- **Usage in machine learning**: Structured data straightforwardly maps to **supervised learning** tasks. Algorithms process specific features to generate precise predictions or classifications.

### Unstructured Data

- **Definition**: Unstructured data is, as the name suggests, devoid of a predefined structure. It doesnâ€™t fit into a tabular format and might contain text, images, audio, or video data.

- **Example**: Customer reviews, social media content, and sensor data are typical sources of unstructured data.

- **Usage in machine learning**: Unstructured data commonly feeds into **unsupervised learning** platforms. Techniques like clustering help derive patterns from such data, and algorithms like k-means can group similar data points together.

Further, advancements in NLP, computer vision, and speech recognition have empowered machine learning to effectively tackle unstructured inputs, such as textual content, images, and audio streams.
<br>

## 5. What is the role of _feature scaling_, and when do you use it?

**Feature Scaling** is a critical step in many machine learning pipelines, especially for algorithms that rely on similarity measures such as Euclidean distance. It ensures that all features contribute equally to the predictive analysis.

### Why Does Feature Scaling Matter?

- **Algorithm Performance**: Models like K-Means clustering and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are sensitive to feature scales. In their absence, features with higher magnitudes can dominate those with lower magnitudes.

- **Convergence**: Gradient-descent based methods converge more rapidly on scaled features.

- **Regularization**: Algorithms like the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) are sensitive to feature magnitudes, meaning unscaled features might be penalized more.

- **Interpretability**: Feature scaling helps models interpret the importance of features in a consistent manner.

### Different Feature Scaling Techniques

1. **Min-Max Scaling**:

$$
X_{\text{new}} = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}
$$

Feature values are mapped to a common range, typically $[0, 1]$ or $[-1, 1]$.

3. **Standardization**:

$$
X_{\text{new}} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Here, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Standardization makes features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

4. **Robust Scaling**:
   This type is similar to standardization, but it uses the median and the interquartile range (IQR) instead of the mean and standard deviation. It is more suited for datasets with outliers.

5. **Unit Vector Scaling**:
   This method scales each feature to have a unit norm (magnitude), making it particularly beneficial for methods that use distances, like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

6. **Gaussian Transformation**:
   Using techniques like the Box-Cox transformation can help stabilize the variance and make the data approximately adhere to the normal distribution, which some algorithms may assume.

### When to Use Feature Scaling

- **Multiple Features**: When your dataset has many interdependent features.
- **Optimization Methods**: With algorithms using gradient descent or those involving constrained optimization.
- **Distance-Based Algorithms**: For methods like KNN, where efficient and accurate computation of distances is paramount.
- **Features with Different Units**: When measurements are in different units or are on different scales, e.g., height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
- **Interpretability**: When interpretability of feature importance across models is of importance.
<br>

## 6. Describe different types of _data normalization_ techniques.

**Data normalization** is essential for ensuring consistent and accurate model training. It minimizes the impact of varying **feature scales** and supports the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

### Importance of Data Normalization

- **Feature Equality**: Normalization ensures that all features contribute proportionally to the model evaluation.
- **Convergence Acceleration**: Algorithms like gradient descent converge faster when input features are scaled.
- **Optimization Effectiveness**: Some optimization algorithms, such as the L-BFGS, require scaled features to be effective and efficient.

### Common Types of Normalization

1. **Min-Max Scaling**
 
$$
\text{Scaled Value} = \frac{\text{Value} - \text{Min}}{\text{Max} - \text{Min}}
$$

   - Suitable when data is known and bounded.
   - Prone to outliers.

2. **Z-Score (Standardization)**
  
$$
\text{Scaled Value} = \frac{\text{Value} - \text{Mean}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}
$$

   - Best for data that is normally distributed.
   - Ensures a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

3. **Robust Scaling**

$$
\text{Scaled Value} = \frac{\text{Value} - \text{Median}}{\text{Interquartile Range}}
$$

   - Useful in the presence of outliers.
   - Scales based on the range within the 25th to 75th percentiles.
<br>

## 7. What is _data augmentation_, and how can it be useful?

**Data Augmentation** involves artificially creating more data from existing datasets, often by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or other modifications.

### Why Use Data Augmentation?

- **Increases Training Examples**: Effectively expands the size of the dataset, which is especially helpful when the original dataset is limited in size.
- **Mitigates Overfitting**: Encourages the model to extract more general features, reducing the risk of learning from noise or individual data points.
- **Improves Generalization**: Leads to better performance on unseen data, key for real-world scenarios.

### Common Data Augmentation Techniques

- **Geometric Transformations**: Rotating, scaling, mirroring, or cropping images.
- **Color Jitter**: Altering brightness, contrast, or color in images.
- **Noise Injection**: Adding random noise to images or audio samples to make the model more robust.
- **Text Augmentation**: Techniques like synonym replacement, back-translation, or word insertion/deletion for NLP tasks.

### Code Example: Image Data Augmentation with Keras

Here is the Python code:

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load sample image
img = plt.imread('path_to_image.jpg')

# Create an image data generator
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rotation_range=40,
        width_shift_range=0.2,
        height_shift_range=0.2,
        shear_range=0.2,
        zoom_range=0.2,
        horizontal_flip=True,
        fill_mode='nearest')

# Reshape the image and visualize the transformations
img = img.reshape((1,) + img.shape)
i = 0
for batch in datagen.flow(img, batch_size=1):
    plt.figure(i)
    imgplot = plt.imshow(np.squeeze(batch, axis=0))
    i += 1
    if i % 5 == 0:
        break
plt.show()
```
<br>

## 8. Explain the concept of _data encoding_ and why itâ€™s important.

**Data encoding** is crucial for preserving  information across systems and during storage, especially in the context of Machine Learning applications that sometimes deal with non-traditional data types.

### Key Reasons for Data Encoding

1. **Compatibility**: Different systems and software might have varied requirements on how data is represented. Encoding ensures data is interpreted as intended.

2. **Interoperability**: Complex applications, especially in Machine Learning, often involve multiple disparate components. A common encoding scheme ensures they can interact effectively.

3. **Text Representation**: Not all data is numerical. Text, categorical values, and even images and audio require appropriate representation for computational processes.

4. **Error Detection and Correction**: Certain encoding schemes offer mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors during transmission or storage.

5. **Efficient Storage**: Some encodings are more space-efficient, which is valuable when dealing with large datasets.

6. **Security**: Certain encoding methods, such as encryption, are crucial for safeguarding sensitive data.

7. **Versioning**: In systems where data structures might evolve, encoding can ease transitions and ensure compatibility across versions.

8. **Internationalization and Localization**: In the case of text data, encoding schemes are necessary for managing multiple languages and character sets.

9. **Data Compression**: This method, often used in multimedia contexts, reduces the size of the data for efficient storage or transmission.

10. **Data Integrity**: By encoding information in a specific way, we ensure it remains intact and interpretable during its lifecycle.

### Common Data Encoding Techniques

- **One-Hot Encoding**: converting categorical variables into a set of binary vectors (0/1, true/false) â€“ useful for algorithms that can process only numeric data.

- **Label Encoding**: converting categorical variables into numerical labels â€“ especially useful in algorithms that can work with unordered categorical data.

- **Binary Encoding**: representing integers with binary digits.

- **Gray Code**: Optimized version of binary code where consecutive values differ by only a single bit.

- **Base64 Encoding**: A technique used for safe data transfer in web protocols and APIs, particularly when data might contain special, non-printable, or multi-byte characters.

- **Unicode**: A global standard to interpret and represent different characters and symbols across diverse languages.

- **JSON and XML**: Standard ways to structure and encode complex data, often used in web services and data interchange. While both JSON and XML supply data in a clear, human-readable format, **XML** has a mechanism for data validity in the form of a schema definition.

- **CSV ("Comma Separated Values")**: Itâ€™s simple, text-based, and serves as a cross-platform data exchange format for spreadsheets and databases.

- **Encryption Algorithms** such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman (RSA).
<br>

## 9. How do you handle _missing data_ within a _dataset_?

**Missing data** presents challenges for statistical analysis and machine learning models. Here are several strategies to handle it effectively.

### Common Ways to Handle Missing Data

1. **Eliminate**: Remove data entries with missing values. While this simplifies the dataset, it reduces the sample size and can introduce bias.

2. **Fill with Measures of Central Tendency**: Impute missing values with statistical measures such as mean, median, or mode. This approach preserves the data structure but can affect statistical estimates.

3. **Predictive Techniques**: Use machine learning models or algorithms to predict missing values based on other features in the dataset.

### Code Example: Basic Handling of Missing Data

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, None, 5],
        'B': ['a', 'b', None, 'c', 'd']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print original DataFrame
print(df)

# Drop rows with any missing values
dropped_df = df.dropna()
print(dropped_df)

# Fill missing values with mean
filled_df = df.fillna(df.mean())
print(filled_df)

# Predict missing values in 'B' based on 'A' using simple imputation
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
df['B'] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['B']])

print(df)
```
<br>

## 10. What is the difference between _imputation_ and _deletion_ of _missing values_?

When dealing with **missing data**, two common strategies are imputation and deletion.

### Deletion

Deletion methods remove instances with missing values. This can be done in multiple fashions:

- **Pairwise Deletion**: Also known as "Complete Case Analysis (CCA)", it involves removing observations on a case-by-case basis. It can lead to inconsistent observations across samples.
- **List Wise Deletion**: This method, used for handling missing values in a variable or record, deletes records with **any** missing values.

### Imputation

**Imputation** involves substituting missing values with either an estimated value or a placeholder, often following a statistical or data-driven approach.

Some common imputation methods include:

- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the feature.
- **Arbitrary Value Imputation**: Using a predetermined value (e.g., 0 or a specific "missing" marker).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation**: Employing the values of k-nearest neighbors to fill in the missing ones.
- **Predictive Model Imputation**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict missing values using other complete variables.

### Pros and Cons

- **Deletion**:
  - Pros: Simple, does not alter the dataset beyond reducing its size.
  - Cons: Reduces data size, potential loss of information, and selective bias.

- **Imputation**:
  - Pros: Preserves data size, retains descriptive information.
  - Cons: Can introduce bias, assumption issues, and reduced variability.

The choice between these methods should consider the unique characteristics of the dataset, the nature of the missingness, and the specific domain needs.
<br>

## 11. Describe the pros and cons of _mean_, _median_, and _mode imputation_.

**Imputation** techniques serve to handle missing data, each with its trade-offs.

### Mean Imputation

- **Pros**: 
  - Generally works for continuous data.
  - No drastic impact on data distribution, especially when the amount of missing data is small.

- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to **biased estimates** of the entire population.
  - Can **distort** the relationships between variables.
  - Especially problematic when the data distribution is skewed.

### Median Imputation

- **Pros**:
  - Unaffected by outliers, making it a better choice for handling skewed distributions.
  - Results in **consistent** estimates.

- **Cons**:
  - Potentially **less efficient** than mean imputation, especially when dealing with symmetric distributions.

### Mode Imputation

- **Pros**:
  - Suitable for **categorical data**.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for continuous data.
  - Ignores the relationships between variables, performing poorly when two variables are related.
<br>

## 12. How does _K-Nearest Neighbors imputation_ work?

**K-nearest neighbors (KNN)** imputation leverages $k$ closest data points to **replace missing values**. This method is frequently employed in exploratory data analysis.

### KNN-Based Imputation Process

1. **Data Setup**: 
   - Feature space dimensions determine **k-nearest neighbors** during imputation.
   - Proceed if the feature set is measurable.
   - Data points with any NaN values are typically removed.
  
2. **Distance Calculation**:

   - **Euclidean distance** is commonly used in a feature space.
   - An optimization technique known as **KD-tree** can expedite distance calculations.

3. **K-Neighbor Selection**: 
   - The top $k$ neighbors are determined based on their calculated distances from the missing point.

4. **Imputation**:

   - Numerical features: The average of the corresponding feature from the $k$ neighbors is used.
   - Categorical features: The mode (most frequent category) is considered.

5. **Sensitivity to k**: 
   - Varying $k$ alters the imputed value, leading to potential difficulties in feature ranking and weight computation.

### Code Example: KNN Imputation

Here is the Python code:

  ```python
  from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
  import numpy as np
  
  # Example feature matrix with missing values
  X = np.array([[1, 2, np.nan], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
  
  # Initialize KNN imputer with 2 nearest neighbors
  imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)
  
  # Impute and display result
  X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)
  print(X_imputed)
  ```
<br>

## 13. When would you recommend using _regression imputation_?

**Regression imputation** can be helpful when dealing with missing data. By leveraging the relationships among variables in your dataset through regression, it imputes missing values more accurately.


### When to Use Regression Imputation

- **Require Accuracy**: The method is especially beneficial when central tendencies like mean or mode are not sufficient. 
- **Continuous Variables**: It's best suited for continuous or ratio scale data. If your data includes such variables and the missing values are MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), regression imputation can be a valuable tool.
- **Data Relationship**: When the missing variable and predictor(s) have a discernible relationship, imputation can be more accurate.

### Related Methods

- **Mean and Mode**: As a simple alternative.
- **KNN Imputation**: Uses the k-nearest neighbors to impute missing values.
- **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**: An iterative method for cases where strong correlation patterns are present.
- **Full Bayesian Multiple Imputation**: It's a complex strategy but can be potent because it accounts for uncertainty in the imputed values.

### Code Example: Regression Imputation

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Read data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split into missing and non-missing data
missing_data = data[data['target_variable'].isnull()]
complete_data = data.dropna(subset=['target_variable'])

# Split the complete data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    complete_data[['predictor1', 'predictor2']],
    complete_data['target_variable'],
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)

# Train the regression model
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict missing values
missing_data['target_variable'] = regressor.predict(missing_data[['predictor1', 'predictor2']])
```
<br>

## 14. How do _missing values_ impact _machine learning models_?

**Missing values** can heavily compromise the predictive power of machine learning models, as most algorithms struggle to work with incomplete data.

### Impact on Model Performance

1. **Bias:** The model might favour specific classes or features, leading to inaccurate predictions.
2. **Increased Error:** Larger variations in predictions can occur due to the absence of crucial data points.
3. **Reduced Power:** The ability of the model to detect true patterns can decrease.
4. **Inflated Significance:** Attributes without missing data can become disproportionately influential, distorting results.

### Dealing with Missing Values

1. **Data Avoidance:** Eliminate records or features with missing values. Though it's a quick fix, it reduces the dataset size and can introduce bias.

2. **Single-value Imputation:** Replace missing values using the attribute's mode, median, or mean. While easy, it can introduce bias.

3. **Hot Deck Imputation**: Replace a missing value with a randomly selected observed value within the same dataset. Can be more effective, especially for non-linear relationships.

4. **Model-based Imputation:** Use an ML algorithm to predict missing values based on available data. This method can be effective if there are patterns in the missing data.

5. **Advanced Techniques**: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Expectation-Maximization (EM), and data-driven methods like Pandas' `.fillna()` all have different degrees of complexity and potential accuracy.

### Code Example: Traditional Imputation Methods

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Initialize the imputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

# Fit the imputer to the data
imputer.fit(data)

# Apply the imputer to the dataset
imputed_data = imputer.transform(data)
```

### Evaluating Imputation Strategies

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measure the absolute difference between imputed and true values, then find the average.

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Calculate the square root of the mean of the squared differences between imputed and true values.

3. **Predictive Accuracy**: Apply different imputation strategies and compare the impact on model performance.

4. **Visual Analysis**: Observe patterns in the data and see how different imputation strategies capture these patterns.
<br>

## 15. What is _one-hot encoding_, and when should it be used?

**One-Hot Encoding (OHE)** is a preprocessing technique for transforming categorical features into a form that is interpretable for machine learning algorithms.

### How it Works

Each categorical variable with $n$ unique categories is transformed into $n$ new binary variables. For a given data point, only one of these binary variables takes on the value 1 (indicating the presence of that category), with all others being 0, which is why it is called **One-Hot** Encoding.

### Use Cases

- **Algorithm Suitability**: Certain algorithms (like regression models) require numeric input, making OHE a prerequisite for categorical data.

- **Algorithm Performance**: OHE can lead to improved model performance by preventing the model from misinterpreting ordinal or nominal categorical data as having a specific order or hierarchy.

- **Visualization**: Transparency of one-hot encoded features is an added benefit for model interpretation and understanding.

### Code Example: One-Hot Encoding

Here is a Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({'Size': ['S', 'M', 'M', 'L', 'S', 'L']})

# One-hot encoding
one_hot_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Size'])
print(one_hot_encoded)
```

Output:

|     | Size_L | Size_M | Size_S |
|----:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
|  0 |      0 |      0 |      1 |
|  1 |      0 |      1 |      0 |
|  2 |      0 |      1 |      0 |
|  3 |      1 |      0 |      0 |
|  4 |      0 |      0 |      1 |
|  5 |      1 |      0 |      0 |

### Key Points

- For $n$ categories, one-hot encoding generates $n$ binary features, potentially leading to the **curse of dimensionality**. This can affect model performance with sparse or high-dimensional data.

- One-hot encoding is undistorted, with **distances** (like Hamming distance) reflecting the true dissimilarities or similarities between categories.

- The variance of one-hot encoded features can become a pitfall in some model algorithms.
